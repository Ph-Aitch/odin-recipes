    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</p>
        </li>

    <h2>How to Store and Freeze Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.</p>
    <p>If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow it to cool completely, then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap. Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or microwave.</p>
