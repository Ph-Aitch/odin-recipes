    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</p></li>
        <li><p>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</p></li>
        <li><p>2 cloves garlic, minced</p></li>
        <li><p>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</p></li>
        <li><p>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</p></li>
        <li><p>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</p></li>
        <li><p>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</p></li>
        <li><p>½ teaspoon salt</p></li>
        <li><p>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</p></li>
        <li><p>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder</p></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness.</p><p>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</p></li>
        <li><p>Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</p></li>
